# _**The Patribots (FRC 4738)**_
### Visit our website at [patribots.org](https://www.patribots.org)!

<br />The Patribots are a school-based _FIRST&reg; Robotics Competition_ team from Patrick Henry High School, located in San Diego, California. 


This repository is entirely student-created and maintained.
Attached to this repository is a GitHub project called [Reefscape 2025](<https://github.com/orgs/Patribots4738/projects/15>) in which we utilize as the Agile framework to organize our workflow. With Agile, we map out the season by dividing it into many week-long sprints. As a team, we agree upon & decide what must be accomplished in each sprint. We declare each assignment by making issues and then implement it in an associated branch. An estimated priority & size are assigned to each issue/assignment which is then filtered into five categories:
  - **Backlog** -> Issues that have no status. Essentially a large to-do list.
  - **Ready** -> Issues that are assigned to a programmer & are ready to begin.
  - **In Progress** -> Issues that are currently being worked on by a programmer.
  - **In Review** -> Issues where the assigned programmer has requested revision by colleagues.
  - **Done** -> Resolved issues with corresponding branches which have merged into our master branch, [`main`](https://github.com/Patribots4738/Crescendo2025/tree/main/src/main).

We also love [drawing boards](https://www.tldraw.com/v/YKJloESPqAyu62wxqEQ8U?v=1783,102,6548,3115&p=page)!
    
We are a team of students, for students, and we are proud to be a part of the _FIRST&reg;_ community.
Thanks for checking us out, & be sure to star this repository if you find anything helpful or interesting!
